# Theory of Data Visualization

Visualization is meant to convey information.

> The power of a graph is its ability to enable one to take in the quantitative information, organize it, and see patterns and structure not readily revealed by other means of studying the data.

\- Cleveland and McGill, 1984

Certain techniques make that information easier to interpret and understand. In their 1984 paper titled, "[Graphical Perception: Theory, Experimentation, and Application to the Development of Graphical Methods](https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/2288400?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)," Cleveland and McGill identify 10 elementary perceptual tasks that are used to "extract quantitative information from graphs." Their premise is:

> A graphical form that involves elementary perceptual tasks that lead to more accurate judgments than another graphical form (with the same quantitative information) will result in better organization and increase the chances of a correct perception of patterns and behavior.

Whereas graph design had, up to that point, been "largely unscientific," Cleveland and McGill took a systematic approach in analyzing human graphical perception through experimentation. Their researched helped identify the most and least accurate elementary perceptual tasks, ordered below:

1. Position along a common scale
2. Position along non-aligned scales
3. Length, direction, angle
4. Area
5. Volume, curvature
6. Shading, color saturation

In 2010, [Heer and Bostock](http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2010-MTurk-CHI.pdf) confirmed these results using Amazon's Mechanical Turk.

Let's take a look at a few examples. Because we're only interested in relative sizes, we don't include a legend with size information or reference points.

![](images/circles.png)


For circles of distinctly different sizes, the comparison is simple. For example, "A" is smaller than "B." However, for circles, such as "L" and "M," that are almost the same size, it's difficult to tell which is smaller. Area, according to Cleveland and McGill's research, is less accurate than, say, length, which we consider next.

![](images/bars.png)


Focusing on "L" and "M," it is clear to see which is larger. You might be wondering whether scale makes a difference -- that is, if the small circle sizes make it difficult to compare -- it doesn't.

Next, we consider a case where we want to plot two series. For this example, let's suppose we're working with student English and math test scores. Here, we'll want to use bars, which we arbitrarily label Z-L. The question is, which bars should we use? This is a case where the answer depends on what we're trying to communicate. If we're interested in showing total scores, we could use a stacked bar chart.

![](images/two-series-0.png)

We can tell that "Y" and "L" had the highest cumulative scores. What if we want to know which students scored highest on the math exam? Because the math portions of each bar are on "non-aligned scales," as Cleveland and McGill call it, it's difficult to tell. One solution is to plot these on opposite sides of the x-axis.

![](images/two-series-1.png)

Now, it's easier to see that "R" scored quite well on the math exam. The tradeoff with this layout is that it's difficult to compare cumulative scores. Comparing "Z" and "O," for example, is a challenge. Again, it depends on what the message is.

These findings are a *guide* for what works when the goal is to make accurate judgments. Sometimes, however, the goal might not be to allow for precise comparisons but, rather, to facilitate the perception of larger patterns. This is usually the case with choropleth maps.

## Form and Function

> A good graphic realizes two basic goals: It **presents** information, and it allows users to **explore** that information.

\- Alberto Cairo

-------------------------

> A data visualization should only be beautiful when beauty can promote understanding in some way without undermining it in another. Is beauty sometimes useful? Certainly. Is beauty always useful? Certainly not.

\- Stephen Few

-------------------------

> Good displays of data help to reveal knowledge relevant to understanding mechanism, process and dynamics, cause and effect.

\- Edward Tufte

-------------------------

>A figure is ineffective if it "wastes too much real estate (and the designer's time) on things that don't help readers understand [it]." 

\- Alberto Cairo

-------------------------

> The important criterion for a graph is not simply how fast we can see a result; rather it is whether through the use of the graph we can see something that would have been harder to see otherwise or that could not have been seen at all.

\- William Cleveland

-------------------------

> [A]lways take advantage of the space you have available to seek depth within reasonable limits. After that, *and only after that*, worry about how to make the presentation prettier.

\- Alberto Cairo

Ultimately, identify your audience and their needs and interests. The same data should be visualized differently for a scientific publication versus a magazine.

# Plotting in R

There are two major sets of tools for creating plots in R:

1. base graphics, which  come with all R installations  
2. `ggplot2`, a stand-alone package.  

Note that other plotting facilities do exist (notably, `lattice`), but base graphics and `ggplot2` are by far the most popular. Check out [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2759556/r-what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-using-lattice-versus-ggplot2) on comparisons between base, `ggplot2`, and `lattice` graphics to learn more.

## Package installation

First, we'll install and import the necessary packages. Let's get started! 

```{r import}
# Uncomment this to install packages, if necessary.
# install.packages(c("cowplot", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "viridis"))

library(cowplot)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
```

## Dataset Details

For the following examples, we will using the gapminder dataset. Gapminder is a country-year dataset with information on life expectancy and GDP per-capita.

```{r import_gap}
gap <- read.csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
head(gap)
str(gap)
```

# R base graphics

Base graphics are nice for quick visualizations of your data. You can make them publication-quality, but they take more effort than those produced by `ggplot2`. Let's review base plotting calls for histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.

## Histograms

Histograms are useful to illustrate the distribution of a single continuous (i.e., numeric or integer) variable. In the gapminder dataset, the histogram is a natural choice for visualizing `lifeExp`:

```{r histogram}
hist(x = gap$lifeExp)

# Define number of breaks
hist(x = gap$lifeExp, breaks = 5)
```

The breaks argument within the `hist()` function allows you to control the amount of bins that are displayed in the histogram.

To make the histogram more informative, we can adjust visual features of the plot. For example, we can customize the title, x-axis label, x- and y-axes limits, the color of bar, and more:

```{r histogram_customize}
hist(x = gap$lifeExp, 
     breaks = 10, 
     col = "skyblue", 
     main = "Histogram of Life Expectancy",
     xlab = "Years",
     xlim = c(20, 90), 
     ylim = c(0, 350), 
     las = 1)
```

You can see the 657 available stock colors available to you by typing `colors()`. Why do you think there so many "greys"?

## Barplots

Barplots are useful to visualize counts and or averages of a single continuous variable - which can be parsed by levels of a factor (if needed). For example, we can use a bar plot to learn how many countries there are per continent that we have data for.

```{r barplot}
# Calculate the number of countries per continent
countries_by_continent <- gap %>%
  dplyr::distinct(country, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(continent) %>%
  dplyr::count() %>%
  dplyr::rename(n_countries = n)

# Creates a bar plot that shows continent on the x-axis and number of countries on the y-axis 
barplot(countries_by_continent$n_countries,
        names.arg = countries_by_continent$continent,
        main = "Number of Countries per Continent")
```

## Boxplots

Boxplots are useful to visualize the distribution of a single continuous variable that can be parsed by levels of a factor (i.e., a categorical feature). For example, we can look at distributions of life expectancy *by* continent:  

```{r boxplot}
boxplot(gap$lifeExp ~ gap$continent,
        main = "Boxplot of Life Expectancy per Continent")

# There are five continents represented in this dataset
levels(gap$continent)
length(levels(gap$continent))
```

Notice that we used a formula in the base R function to specify the relationship we wanted the boxplot to demonstrate.


## Scatter plots

Scatter plots are useful for visualizing the relationship between two numeric quantities. Typically, these quantities are continuous, but scatterplots can sometimes effectively convey comparisons of discrete quantities as well.

In the following example, we will look at the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy in country of Portugal. Notice that we can also view these plots as line plots. However, line plots are typically used when one axis is ordered (e.g., it might be a year).

```{r scatter_plot}
portugal <- dplyr::filter(gap, country == "Portugal")

# Points
plot(x = portugal$gdpPercap, y = portugal$lifeExp,
     type = "p",
     xlab = "GDP per capita",
     ylab = "Life Expectancy",
     main = "GDP per-capita vs. Life Expectancy in Portugal") 

# Connected lines (not a smoothing line)
plot(x = portugal$gdpPercap, y = portugal$lifeExp,
     type = "l",
     xlab = "GDP per capita",
     ylab = "Life Expectancy",
     main = "GDP per-capita vs. Life Expectancy in Portugal") 

# Both
plot(x = portugal$gdpPercap, y = portugal$lifeExp,
     type = "b",
     xlab = "GDP per capita",
     ylab = "Life Expectancy",
     main = "GDP per-capita vs. Life Expectancy in Portugal") 
```

# The `ggplot2` way

Base plotting is just fine, but it takes some slightly complicated code to map colors to points and shapes of a given variable. And, adding a legend gets even trickier. Thankfully, a package called `ggplot2` handles these complexities with ease using more compact code inspired by Leland Wilkinson's **g**rammar of **g**raphics. 

> NOTE: `ggplot2` is the name of the package, but `ggplot` is the main function call. 
A ggplot is comprised of three fundamental building blocks:

1. **Data:** typically as a dataframe.
2. **"aes"thetics:** to define your x and y axes, map colors to factor levels, etc.  
3. **"geom_"s:** the visual marks to represent your data - points, bars, lines, ribbons, polygons, etc. 

One thing to remember is that `ggplot2` works in layers, similar to photoimaging software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Inkscape, GIMP, ImageJ, etc. We create a base layer, and then stack layers on top of that base layer. New layers are added to a plot using  the addition **`+`** symbol. Lastly, plots can be further customized using a host of **"theme_"** functions.
 
## Building a histogram layer by layer

We'll demonstrate the layer-based approach in `ggplot2` by building the same histogram of age as in the previous section.

### Define the base layer

First, to construct the base layer, we pass in two arguments to the `ggplot` function: the data and the global aesthetics (the ones that apply to all layers of the plot) defined within `aes()`. Once we do this, we see our coordinate system, but no data! 

Notice that the output of the `ggplot` function can be stored in a variable, which we've called `plot`. This allows us to continually add layers to `plot` in downstream code, and visualize how it looks at different points.

```{r base_layer}
plot <- ggplot(data = gap, aes(x = lifeExp))
print(plot)
```

### Add the histogram layer

We need the last building block: a `geom_` function, which in this case, is `geom_histogram`. Add `geom_histogram` to see the data!

```{r histogram_layer}
plot <- 
  ggplot(data = gap, aes(x = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "orange", fill = "green")
show(plot)
```

Ahh, my eyes! Always avoid [chartjunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartjunk)! Keep your visualizations simple and crisp so that they can efficiently communicate their point without losing your audience in chartjunk.

Note that we can also make a density plot with a similar structure as a histogram. This time we will make sure to avoid the ugly coloring. 

```{r density_layer}
plot <- ggplot(data = gap, aes(x=lifeExp))+
  geom_density()

```

A density plot computes a kernel density estimate, which you can think of as the smoothed version of the histogram. We like using them when we have continuous data that comes from a smooth distribution. Importantly for this workshop, note that the only difference we made between the histogram and the density plot was changing which geom_* we were interested in. 

### Customize with theme layers

Themes in `ggplot2` are top-level layers which can be use to stylize and customize plots. These themes contain many components, which can be used to change every part of the plot, including the fonts, label sizes, label placements, and more. `ggplot2` comes with some built-in themes that you can easily add to a plot to give it a clean, recognizable, and consistent style. One of the most commonly used themes is a black and white theme, denoted by `theme_bw()`:

```{r hist_w_theme}
plot <- 
  ggplot(data = gap, aes(x = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "black", 
                 fill = "gray80", 
                 bins = 10) + 
  theme_bw()
show(plot)
```

We can also use label and title layers to customize the axis and title labels. Note, however, the syntax differences of each layer compared to base plotting arguments from earlier.

```{r hist_w_labels}
hist <- 
  ggplot(data = gap, aes(x = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "black", 
                 fill = "gray80", 
                 bins = 10) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  ggtitle("Histogram of Life Expectancy") + 
  xlab("Years") + 
  ylab("Frequency") 
show(hist)
```

We can also assign this visualization to a variable for later use

> **Challenge 1:** Open `R-Data-Visualization-Challenges.Rmd`. Create a histogram of cholesterol in the heart dataset using `ggplot`. Save it in a variable named `A`.

## Barplots, `ggplot` style

Barplots operate similarly in `ggplot`, but instead of providing a formula, we simply specify the aesthetic and tack on a `geom_col`:

```{r barplot_ggplot}
ggplot(countries_by_continent, aes(x = continent, y = n_countries)) +
  geom_col() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  xlab("Continent") +
  ylab("Number of Countries") +
  ggtitle("Number of Countries per Continent")
```

There also exists a `geom_bar` function. This can be used to count the number of entries per group for us, so we don't have to do it ourselves:

```{r geom_bar}
ggplot(gap %>% dplyr::distinct(country, .keep_all = TRUE),
       aes(x = continent)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  xlab("Continent") +
  ylab("Number of Countries") +
  ggtitle("Number of Countries per Continent")
```

## Boxplots, `ggplot` style

Boxplots in `ggplot2` are similar to base boxplots, but the helpful additions and customizations are easier to understand and define. In this case, however, the aesthetic is a little more involved that in the case of the histogram.

Let's repeat the previous exercise with boxplots. We have two variables: the continent status and the life expectancy. We need to provide both of these to the aesthetic, so that `ggplot2` knows how to structure the boxplot. We can also provide an optional `fill` variable, which we'll assign to be the diabetes status. 

Take a look at the plot: how did our inputs to the aesthetic correspond to the outputs? What did the fill variable do? How is it different from a color option? Try removing the fill to see how the plot looks without it.

```{r boxplot_gap}
ggplot(data = gap, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, fill = continent)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_minimal()
```

Notice that the fill in this case is a **redundant encoding** of continent. It doesn't tell us any new information. In general, this is considered bad practice - we want to keep our plots as simple as possible. If the continent is already captured by the $x$-axis, we shouldn't need to use color to convey it as well. However, there are exceptions to every rule, and sometimes it may be useful to redundantly encode a variable.

In the above plot, we have a legend, now that we've used the `fill` option. The legend can be moved around by adding the `legend.position` argument of a theme layer that is applied on top of the minimal theme we're working with:

```{r boxplot_gap_legend}
ggplot(data = gap, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, fill = continent)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

> **Challenge 2:** Open `R-Data-Visualization-Challenges.Rmd`. Create a boxplot of cholesterol as a function of sex in the heart dataset using `ggplot`. Save it in a variable named `B`.

## Scatter plots, `ggplot` style

Scatter plots in `ggplot2` are very similar as above, but this time, we use the `geom_point` function. Let's examine life expectancy by GDP per capita, but also include information about the continent, using the color option:

```{r scatter_ggplot}
ggplot(data = gap, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_test()
```

Notice that the `color` argument in the aesthetic allowed us to capture another dimension of the data. This is a key idea: the aesthetic captures the relationships amongst the data, while the geometry specifies how they're visualized.

Now, let's take a look at a variety of ways we can further customize the scatter plot.

### Custom scale breaks

Suppose we want to adjust the points at which the axis ticks appear. We can use the `scale_` theme layers to do so, by specifying "custom breaks". Specifically, to create a custom scale that goes *from* a start point *to* some end point *by* some interval, we do:

```{r custom_scale}
ggplot(data = gap, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "top", 
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 120000, by = 20000), limits = c(0, 120000)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 20, to = 90, by = 10), limits = c(20, 90))
```

### Point sizes, shapes, transparencies

Let's push how far we can take the aesthetic and theme customizations we can do:

```{r point_sizes_theme}
ggplot(data = gap, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, 
                       color = continent, 
                       shape = continent)) + 
  # We add the alpha argument to control the opacity of each data point that is displayed.
  # Alpha accepts values between 0 and 1, with lower values indicating more transparency.
  geom_point(alpha = 0.50, size = 2) + 
  theme_bw() + # Does it still work if you add this theme after the other theme? 
  theme(legend.position = "top", 
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 120000, by = 20000), limits = c(0, 120000)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 90, by = 10), limits = c(20, 90)) +
  xlab("GDP Per Capita") +
  ylab("Life Expectancy") + 
  ggtitle("Life Expectancy vs. GDP Per Capita across Years and Countries")
```

Notice that we are redundantly encoding continent via shape and color. In this plot, it probably doesn't serve much purpose - but we are demonstrating how you can easily use both aspects of the aesthetic to provide more information in ``ggplot``.

### Log-transforming axes

Alternatively, you can [log transform](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/298/in-linear-regression-when-is-it-appropriate-to-use-the-log-of-an-independent-va) an axis. This is useful in the plot we are examining, because GDP per capita varies over several orders of magnitude:

```{r log_transform}
scatter <- ggplot(data = gap, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, 
                       color = continent)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.50, size = 2) + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "top", 
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 90, by = 10), limits = c(20, 90)) +
  xlab("GDP Per Capita") +
  ylab("Life Expectancy") + 
  ggtitle("Life Expectancy vs. GDP Per Capita across Years and Countries")
show(scatter)
```

> **Challenge 3:** Open `R-Data-Visualization-Challenges.Rmd`. Create a scatter plot of cholesterol as a function of age in the heart dataset using `ggplot`. Save it in a variable named `C`.

## Line plots, `ggplot` style

Line plots are useful for visualizing change in some variable on the y-axis plotted against time

We'll calculate the the mean `lifeExp` for each continent by year. Check out D-Lab's [Data Wrangling and Manipulation in R](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-wrang) to learn more! 

```{r mean_life_exp}
gap_mean_life_exp = gap %>%
  dplyr::group_by(year, continent) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp))

head(gap_mean_life_exp)
```

Next, we'll plot the mean life expectancy using `geom_line`:

```{r lineplot}
ggplot(gap_mean_life_exp, aes(x = year,
                              y = mean_lifeExp,
                              color = continent)) + 
  geom_line(lwd = 2) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

Let's customize the legend. We can:

- remove the legend title  
- increase the spacing of the legend items  
- right align the legend text  
- move labels to left of glyphs  

```{r line_plot_legend}
line <- ggplot(gap_mean_life_exp,
               aes(x = year,
                   y = mean_lifeExp, 
                   color = continent)) + 
  geom_line(lwd = 2) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "right", 
        legend.title = element_blank(), 
        legend.text = element_text(color = "black", size = 10, face = "bold"), 
        legend.key.width = unit(2.54, "cm"),
        legend.text.align = 1,
        legend.key = element_rect(size = 3, fill = "white", colour = NA),
        legend.key.size = unit(1, "cm")) + 
  guides(color = guide_legend(label.position = "left")) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Mean Life Expectancy")

show(line)
```

## Heatmaps, `ggplot` style

Heatmaps are useful when you want to plot three variables: one (usually) continuous variable (as the color on the heatmap) by two factors (each of the axes). Let's make a simple heatmap, examining the life expectancy as a function of continent and year:

```{r heatmap}
heat <- ggplot(gap, aes(x = continent, y = year, fill = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_tile() + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white",
                      high = "gray20", 
                      limits = c(20,90),
                      breaks = seq(20, 90, 10)) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 1952, to = 2007, by = 5),
                     limits = c(1947, 2012)) + 
  guides(fill = guide_colourbar(label.position = "left"))
show(heat)
```

## Subplots with a facet wrap

An alternative approach to showing the previous plot is to separate each of the individual curves into their own subplots. This can be done with a `facet_wrap`, in which we choose a variable (i.e., a facet) by which to split the plot into individual subplots:

```{r facet_wrap}
facet_line <- line + 
  facet_wrap(~continent) + 
  guides(linetype = "none") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
show(facet_line)
```

A word about the colors here. While these colors are arguably distinct, it's not the case that the base colors necessarily will be. It's estimated that, "globally, 1 in 12 males and 1 in 200 females are colorblind." The most common form of color blindness is red-green color blindness. **Viridis** is a color palette with an emphasis on accessibility for those of us who experience colorblindness. 

To show the difference with a colorblind friendly palette, let's remake the same facet_line chart. 

```{r, facet_colorblind}
facet_line_cb <- line + 
  facet_wrap(~continent) + 
  guides(linetype = "none") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+
  scale_color_viridis_d()
show(facet_line_cb)
```

Note that we have overridden the default colors from our line graph and replaced them with a colorblind friendly palette. Every line color is now clearly distinct for users. 


> **Challenge 4:** Open `R-Data-Visualization-Challenges.Rmd`. Create a line plot of the mean cholesterol for each age, separated by sex using the heart data. You will need to do some data manipulation with `dplyr` to make this plot. Save your plot to a variable named `D`.

# Creating compound figures using `cowplot`

Publication quality figures often incorporate several subplots, which together tell a narrative about the problem being studied. We saw above that `ggplot2` can create something like a subplot using facets, but it can be quite limited. A package called `cowplot` makes it easy to stitch together individual plots into a bigger figure:

```{r compound_figure}
compound <- plot_grid(hist, scatter, facet_line, heat, 
                      nrow = 2,
                      ncol = 2,
                      scale = 0.85, 
                      labels = c("A)", "B)", "C)", "D)"))
show(compound)
```

# Exporting

Exporting graphs in R is straightforward. Start by clicking the "Export" button:

1. Click **Copy to clipboard...** if you want to quickly copy/paste a figure into a slideshow presentation or text document.

2. Click **Save as image...** (Raster/Bitmap formats such as .png, .jpeg, .tiff) if you want to explort to this format.

> NOTE: Not recommended because every pixel of a plot contains its own separate coding; not so great if you want to resize the image  

3. Click **Save as PDF...** (Vector format such as .pdf, .ps) to export to .pdf.  

> NOTE: Recommended! Every element of a plot is encoded with a function that gives its coding conditional on several factors, which makes it great for resizing. 

4. Or, **export with `ggsave`**  

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Assume we saved our plot is an object called example.plot
ggsave(filename = "compound.pdf",
       plot = compound, 
       width = 12,
       height = 8,
       units = "in",
       dpi = 600)
```

> **Challenge 5:** Open `R-Data-Visualization-Challenges.Rmd`. Use `cowplot` to create a compound figure named `compound_figure` that contains subplots `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` that you created above.
